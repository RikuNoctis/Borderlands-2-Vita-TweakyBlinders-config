# Borderlands-2-Vita-TweakyBlinders-config
 An altered config file for Borderlands 2for the vita to increase playability and fps. There are no graphical differences as the config has no effect on graphical settings.

Copy the ngptoc.txt file to ux0/apps/pcse00383/WillowGame

Copy the coalescedINT file to ux0/apps/pcse00383/WillowGame/CookedNGP

Rename the original files instead of deleting them in case you encounter an error on boot.


If you get an error on boot follow these steps to see if it resolves it...

-copy over the files before installing any DLC
-after the update from pkgj installs, check that the live update icon isnt shown on the games pre boot screen,
if it is, update through live update.
-Start the game with the default config and create a save game then copy over the altered config


This has been tested and working on the EU and US nonpdrm versions. NOT TESTED ON MAI
